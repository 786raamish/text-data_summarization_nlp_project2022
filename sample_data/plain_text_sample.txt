What is canary deployment? Canary deployment works similarly to blue-green deployment, but uses a slightly different method. Instead of another full environment waiting to be switched over once deployment is finished, canary deployments cut over just a small subset of servers or nodes first, before finishing the others.There are many ways to configure your environment for canary deployments. The simplest way is to set up your environment behind your load balancer as normal, but keep an additional node or server or two (depending on the size of your application) as an unused spare. This spare node or server group is the deployment target for your CI/CD pipeline. Once you build, deploy, and test this node, you add it back into your load balancer for a limited time for a limited group of people. This allows you to make sure changes are successful before you repeat the process with the other nodes in your cluster.The other option for configuring a canary deployment is to use a development pattern called feature toggles. Feature toggles (sometimes called feature flags) work by building and deploying your changes to an application controlled by a configuration that switches those changes on.
