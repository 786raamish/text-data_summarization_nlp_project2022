            "Robotics, design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured environment. Today’s industrial robots do not resemble human beings; a robot in human form is called an android. Compared to other artifacts with single functions, robots are expected to perform a variety of tasks, among which communication has an important role. A typical example is a humanoid robot, the building of which has been regarded as the final target of robotics for many years, especially in Japan where many robotics researchers have been struggling with making humanoid robots work in our society. Regardless of such efforts, no definition of humanoid robots exists since “robot” itself has no clear definition. From the viewpoint of biology, human beings can be discriminated from other species by three distinctive features or capabilities. They are biped walking, use instrumentation, and have the invention/use of language. The first two capabilities have been attacked by robotics researchers as challenges in locomotion and manipulation that are the main issues in robotics. The third capability has not been considered as within robotics but linguistics. It seems far away from robotics. However, recent progress of research activities developed by the idea of “embodiment” in behavior-based robotics proposed by Rod Brooks at the MIT AI laboratory in the late 1980s has caused more conceptual issues such as body scheme, body image, self, consciousness, theory of mind, communication, and the emergence of language. Although these issues have been attacked in the existing disciplines such as brain science, neuroscience, cognitive science, and developmental psychology, robotics may project a new light on understanding these issues by constructing artifacts similar to us. Thus, robotics covers a broad range of disciplines; therefore it seems very difficult to find comprehensive textbooks to understand the area. Some textbooks focus on the fundamental issues on how to build robots while others focus on a limited area in robotics such as kinematics, dynamics, control, vision, or planning. Among them, Russell and Norvig's book from 1995 entitled Artificial Intelligence—A Modern Approach gave a good introduction to robotics from the viewpoint of AI. Pfeifer and Scheier's book from 1999 entitled Understanding Intelligence shows a constructive approach to understanding intelligence with a variety of robots from the viewpoint of embodied cognitive science. Readers can access resources on the recent activities of robotics around the world through the Web.\n"

            "Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans.\n",
            "Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured environment.\n",
            "Compared to other artifacts with single functions, robots are expected to perform a variety of tasks, among which communication has an important role.\n",
            "From the viewpoint of biology, human beings can be discriminated from other species by three distinctive features or capabilities.\n",
            "The first two capabilities have been attacked by robotics researchers as challenges in locomotion and manipulation that are the main issues in robotics.\n",
            "However, recent progress of research activities developed by the idea of “embodiment” in behavior-based robotics proposed by Rod Brooks at the MIT AI laboratory in the late 1980s has caused more conceptual issues such as body scheme, body image, self, consciousness, theory of mind, communication, and the emergence of language.\n",
            "Although these issues have been attacked in the existing disciplines such as brain science, neuroscience, cognitive science, and developmental psychology, robotics may project a new light on understanding these issues by constructing artifacts similar to us.\n",
            "Among them, Russell and Norvig's book from 1995 entitled Artificial Intelligence—A Modern Approach gave a good introduction to robotics from the viewpoint of AI.\n",

            "Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks,  convolutional neural networks and Transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]\n",
            "The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1967.[26] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling.[27] Other deep learning working architectures, specifically those built for computer vision, began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980.[28]\n",
            "Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years.[46][47][48] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively.[49] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing[43] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.[50][51] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.\n",
            "Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved.[64][65] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were superseded for ASR by CTC[57] for LSTM.[55][59][66][67][68] but are more successful in computer vision.\n",
            "The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets (DNN) might become practical.\n",
            "However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.[64] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different,[70] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems.[8][71][72] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs.\n",
            "A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.[9][12] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.[98] These components as a whole function similarly to a human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.[citation needed]\n",

            "Ten years have passed since the Dudleys found their nephew on his front step. The sun rises and lights up the brass numbers four on the door, which is almost exactly as it had appeared on the night of Mr. Durson's first visit to the house. The photographs on the wall show how much time has passed. Now there are pictures of a young boy riding his bicycle with his father and playing a game with his mother. Harry is still there, sleeping at the moment. His aunt wakes him up and asks him to look after some bacon. He tells her that he wants everything perfect on dudley1s birthday. She says nothing but nothing. Harry gets dressed and goes down the hall to the kitchen. It looks like Dudly had gotten all the new things he wanted for his birthday without saying anything about the racing bike or the second television. In fact, only one thing makes sense to Harry: he doesn1t look any different from Dudle. He wears old clothes because of all those times Dudsley punched him in the nose. He has a thin scar over his forehead that reminds him of lightning. When asked by his aunt how he got this scar, she says that when his parents died, she said not to ask questions.\n"
